# Roadmap

Hopefully this will keep me on track

## Installation Process

- [ ] Add git user for managing uploads
- [ ] Configure the git user to be able to run scripts that are part of this
      package
- [ ] Add another user that handles the installation process (maybe, need to
      check on this part)


## Project Setup Plugins

- [ ] Define structure for using plugins to install a project
- [ ] Determine the best way to store the information for each project

## Git "CLI" Interface

I'll be creating a set of tools that can be used if a user SSHs into a server as
the `gittack` user.  These will allow people to

- [ ] List projects
- [ ] Add projects
- [ ] Remove projects (including their data)
- [ ] Configure projects
- [ ] Configure SSH keys for the `gittack` user
