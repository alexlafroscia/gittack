gittack
=======

Deploy your web sites with Git!

Based on [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/8393580)

For now, Gittack only supports Ubuntu 12.04, because that's what I'm developing
it on.  I'll verify support for more recent Ubuntu versions once the basic
features are done, and then start adding support for more Linux OSes (and Mac,
too).  I'll be building Gittack with support for multiple types of servers in
mind from the get-go.
